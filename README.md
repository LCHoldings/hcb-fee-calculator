This projects calculates the (7%) transaction fee for HCB transactions. Mainly to make it easier to donate with covered fees without using HCB's donation form. For example, if you will recieve a check or bank transfer. You can use this to give the donor the exact amount to send to cover the fees.

This works for any fee that is a percentage of the total amount. You can use this for any other purpose as well if you want to calculate a percentage of a total amount. Thanks to whoever gave me the idea to make this! Someone was asking if there was a way to calculate the fee for HCB donations and there wasnt really any except the donation form. So I made this!

If something isnt working, shoot me a message on [Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07F2QA059B) or open an issue here on GitHub!
